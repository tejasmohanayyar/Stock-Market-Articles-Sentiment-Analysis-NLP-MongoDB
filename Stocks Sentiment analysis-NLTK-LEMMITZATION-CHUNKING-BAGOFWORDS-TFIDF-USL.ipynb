    "Post the pandemic the stock market has been extremely volatile and hence has made investors more nervous to invest in the market. Though I would still say that the sentiments of people cannot be entirely judged based on news articles, a pattern may be found between previous days news and next days trading behaviour. Since the stock market is the people's market, nobody can predict the price with 100% ceertainty. The outcomes of this project can be taken into account as one of the factors for investors to decide on whether to invest in the market or not."
