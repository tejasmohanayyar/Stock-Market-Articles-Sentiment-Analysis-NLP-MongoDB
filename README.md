# Stock Market Sentiment Analysis using NLP

* While investing in the stock market, experts have often mentioned various parameters to be checked of a company before investing in their stocks.
* This includes the companies fundamental analysis and Technical Analysis.
* What is the intrinsic value of a stock currently and whether a stock is over valued or undervalued?

* Along with the above parameters, experts also heavily rely on everyday after market news to get a grip around which sectors are bullish and bearish.
* In order to make news analysis simple I have developed a simple python script that would scrap news data from an indian news website and have applied NLP techniques to analyze the sentiment of each headline.
* This can be incredibly helpful to investors who are just looking for positive news or negative news allowing them to easily further research upon a short list of companies that they would like to buy or sell.
* Usually if the news is good the market turns bullish towards a stock and bearish otherwise.
