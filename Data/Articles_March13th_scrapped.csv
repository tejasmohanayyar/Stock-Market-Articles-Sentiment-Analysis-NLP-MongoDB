"March 13,2021",Paul Black's 3 thumb rules to pick great wealth creators,"Black says in order to become a successful growth investor, one should be optimistic about the future because optimists can conquer great heights.","Eminent portfolio manager Paul Black says the best way investors can ensure consistent wealth creation is by betting on good growth companies with superior culture that have a strong competitive advantage over peers.

Black says in order to become a successful growth investor, one should be optimistic about the future because optimists can conquer great heights.

“If you look back through history, optimists are the ones who ultimately get it right. Buffett says it all the time: never bet against America. I'd say never bet against great growth companies with superior cultures and the ones that are highly competitively advantaged,” Black said in an interview with CapitalAllocatorsPodcast.com.

Paul Black is the co-CEO and fund manager at the California-based WCM Investment Management, which manages over $42 billion in investor money. He joined the firm in 1989 and attributes its investing success to a lot of hard work and also good fortune.


How Black got interested in stocks
Black says he got interested in stocks at a very young age, and when he inherited some money from his grandfather he decided to invest them in the stock market.

“I bought 500 shares of a company called Eastery Fontaine South African gold miner, when I was in college. I would open up the Wall Street Journal every morning and when gold was going from $300 to $800 an ounce in that period from 1978 to 1982, I would literally look at the newspaper and say: ‘I'd make $500 a day owning 500 shares of this South African gold miner that was highly levered.’ And so that kinda got me hooked,” says he.

Black feels one can learn a lot about the basics of investment by reading all time investment classics from legendary investors. Black names Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Phil Fisher as one of his all-time favourites.

He prefers growth investing to value investing as he feels value investors are a little bit more pessimistic while growth investors tend to see the world more positively.


Keep learning from past mistakes
Black says investors should keep learning from past mistakes and use them as a source of strength to get better and better. “Anyone who doesn't believe that most of life is learning from your failures just doesn't quite get it or they're too young to get it,” says he.

Black says most rapidly growing companies look very attractive to buy, but investors should be wary as ultimately they can be massive destroyers of wealth.


Qualities of a great growth company
Black says if one just looks for high quality, wide-moat businesses selling cheaply, they run the risk of falling into value traps.

According to him, to find a great growth company, one needs to look at two things :- 


1.
They need to stay focused on the direction of the competitive advantage and pay attention to a moat that is growing

“Everybody's business is either getting stronger versus competitors or getting weaker. You want to be able to make the case, through pattern recognition and other tools around 'moat-typologies' as we classify it, that the company you're looking to invest in has a strong likelihood of growing its competitive advantage over the next five, 10 and 15 years. If you get that right, any valuation work you do is going to look ludicrously cheap five and 10 years out,” he says.

Black says it is essential to pay attention to the moat that is growing, as a shrinking moat can be dangerous.

""If we find a growing moat, how do we have any confidence it will keep growing? We found the number one way that convinces us of that is if the culture is aligned to the moat. We want to see behaviours that enhance the competitive position,” he says.


2. 
They need to put a huge premium on the corporation's culture

Black says investors should try to understand the DNA of a business and know what the core values are, and how they relate to the competitive advantage.

“The distinguishing characteristic in any investment has got to be determining what the core values are, what animates that culture and making sure that there is an alignment. When you're assessing a culture, the strongest companies are going to be where the cultures and values are aligned with the competitive advantage,"" says he.


How to assess a company’s culture
Black says while assessing the culture of a company, one of the best things to do is not just talk to the CEO or CFO, but to talk to people who have left on good terms.

“If you talk to people who used to work there and left on good terms, you usually get a pretty good picture. What you are doing is building a mosaic when you're going after culture. A lot of people don't do it because you can't quantify it, you can't put it in a box and score it, or scale and number ranking. You really have to build a mosaic,” says he.

Black says investors should talk to suppliers, vendors and competitors to find out which company they like and which one they do not.


Rising ROIC indicates growing competitive advantage
Black says a rising RoIC (Return on Invested Capital) is a great indication of growing competitive advantage, but the only problem with that is it is practically useless because the good news is already in the stock price long before it shows up in the financials.

“Most managers screen for a hurdle on the ROIC over the past five years. What we've found more valuable than just the ROIC level is the direction. There is a 1:1 correlation between the direction of the ROIC over a five-year time period and stock performance. If you break the market down into five quintiles, from the top quintile where they have the most rapidly rising ROIC to the bottom where they have declining ROICs, there is a 1:1 relationship between the best performing stocks on the top quintile and the poorest performing stocks on the bottom,” he says.

Investors should prefer to invest in a company whose ROIC is growing steadily over the years than a company having a high ROIC for a year and then getting stagnant over the next few years.


Do things differently to gain competitive advantage
Black says most analysts spend 95 per cent of their time crunching numbers, running DCF models, which has zero competitive advantage because there are thousands of analysts doing the same work.

So he feels one should do things that other people are not doing in order to get a massive competitive advantage.

Hold on to companies with great culture for long term
Black says it is not very easy to find companies with great cultures, which are aligned to their competitive advantage. If one is able to spot these kind of companies, then one should hold on to them for a long time.

""In investing, time is your friend. People who make a lot of money in investing are those who buy great businesses with expanding moats. They give them time to work for them over five, 10 and 15 years. All the people that have created a lot of wealth for themselves didn't do it in a week, or three months or six months. They did it over a generation,"" he says.


Manage the downside of your portfolio
Black said it is essential for investors to manage the downside of their portfolios. This, he feels, can be done by being right on the direction of competitive advantage more often than not, because in difficult times, if investors own companies that aren't constrained by the financial markets, they can allocate capital into the space their weaker competitors cannot.


Keep a positive attitude
Black says investors should ignore the pessimists and always keep a positive attitude while investing. 
“Humans are naturally wired to look at everything that can go wrong, and we tend to miss what is good that dominates most of the time,” he says.


Stay focused and ignore market chatter
Black says investors should keep their focus on what they are doing and avoid paying heed to the constant market chatter and noise around them.

“Constant chatter that goes on forces you to be short-term in your orientation, to make decisions in 3 and 6 months versus five and seven-year periods required,” he says.

Companies that build effective corporate cultures tend to be better performers, as they have a competitive advantage that sets them apart from the rest of the pack, giving them a wide moat.

Hence, it is no big surprise that businesses that continually widen their moat each year continue to perform for longer periods of time because they become harder and harder to compete against.

"March 13,2021","Dalal Street week ahead: Addition of fresh shorts, even PCR levels signal a technical bounce","In the coming week, the rise and volatility in the US bond yield will be watched closely; a stronger US dollar will continue to remain a cause of concern temporarily for the emerging markets as a whole.","In a truncated week, Indian equities failed to take any directional cues and the indices went all over the place in the four trading sessions, before ending the week with a modest gain.

The start of the week was volatile with Nifty trading in a wide range. However, the first part of the week saw a wider trading range of over 634 points, while the previous four session saw Nifty oscillate in a relatively narrower 416-point range.

Broadly speaking, Nifty continued to face resistance at the lower top formed on the daily charts, which has the 15,250-15,300 zone offering stiff resistance. Following a sharp correction seen on the last trading day of the week, the headline index ended with a net gain of 92.85 points, or 0.62 per cent.

Despite improving market breadth, Nifty confirmed its slippage into a broad-range consolidation. On the higher side, the 15,250-15,300 zone continued to act as stiff resistance. Unless this zone is taken out, Nifty will struggle to see any meaningful upside. Despite wide-ranging moves, volatility tapered down and INDIA VIX came off 15.07% to 21.71 level on a weekly basis.


In the coming week, the rise and volatility in the US bond yield will be watched closely; a stronger US dollar will continue to remain a cause of concern temporarily for the emerging markets as a whole.

Nifty has made a higher top and bottom on the weekly charts. Given the sharpness of the fall on the last trading session, there is a strong possibility of a technical pullback when we begin the new week. Nifty added fresh shorts in the system and the PCR across all expiries stood even at 1.02. This may aid a likely technical pullback next week. The 15,180 and 15,300 levels are likely to act as key resistance points while supports will come in at 14,900 and 14,850 levels.

Regardless of the market direction, Nifty trading range is likely to widen in the coming days. The weekly RSI stood at 68.24; it remains neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD remains bullish and has gone above the Signal Line. A candle with a long upper shadow occurred. Such candles, if they emerge near the high point, may have the potential to disrupt the ongoing trend.

However, there are larger possibilities of continued consolidation.

Pattern analysis of the weekly charts showed Nifty has slipped into a broad-range consolidation with the immediate resistance placed in the 15,250-15,300 zone. Though the immediate support remains in the 14,850-14,900 zone, the fastest 20-week MA is much away from the current level at 13,855. This shows the extent to which the Nifty has deviated from its mean. The wider-than-normal Bollinger Bands indicates that even if there are no major corrective move, the index may well stay in a broadly defined range and go through some wide-ranged consolidation in the coming days.

All and all, the broader market has continued to outperform relatively. The overall market breadth is improving, and this is a good sign. Also, a good number of fresh shorts have been added to the system. However, regardless of the shorts that may lend support in the form of short-covering from lower levels, fresh buying in the cash market would be an absolute necessity.

Apart from any short covering-led bounce, it would be important to see if fresh buying takes place. The market has become highly stock specific in nature. As mentioned in the previous weekly note, we will see pockets of stock-specific outperformances and the defensive plays will continue to remain on the forefront. We recommend not chasing any particular sector as a theme, but staying highly stock-specific and selective in the approach.

With the rupee depreciating, IT may well show improved relative strength along with auto, energy, infrastructure and select midcap stocks. While staying light on the leveraged exposure, a cautious approach with vigilant profit protection at higher levels is advised for the coming week.

In our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectoral indices against CNX500 (Nifty500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free-float market-cap of all the listed stocks.



A review of the Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG) threw up some interesting insights. Nifty PSE and Infrastructure indices have entered the leading quadrant. Nifty Auto and Commodities groups also continue to be in the leading quadrant along with Nifty MidCap100 Index, while continues to maintaining its relative momentum. The Smallcap Index is also in the leading quadrant, but appears to be paring its relative momentum. However, these groups will continue to relatively outperform the broader Nifty500 Index.

Nifty Realty Index has slipped inside the weakening quadrant, while Nifty Bank, Services Sector and IT indices are now in the weakening quadrant. The Metal Index is seen rotating back to the leading quadrant, as it shows a sharp improvement in relative momentum against the broader market.

Nifty Media, Pharma, FMCG and Consumption indices continued to languish inside the lagging quadrant. They are rotating in a south-westerly direction, and these groups are likely to relatively underperform the broader market over the coming days.

Nifty Energy Index remains in the improving quadrant. However, it is making a steady north-easterly rotation and is expected to continue posting a resilient show in the coming week.

Important Note: RRGTM charts show the relative strength and momentum for a group of stocks. In the above chart, they show relative performance against Nifty500 index (broader market) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.

"March 13,2021",World market themes for the week ahead,The central bank which pioneered yield curve control faces one of its toughest policy reviews on March 18-19.,"Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week.


1/ TIME TO PUSH BACK?
After a stunning selloff in U.S. Treasuries took benchmark 10-year yields above 1.6%, the highest in a year, the March 16-17 Federal Reserve meeting will be watched closely for hints policymakers are concerned about yields, asset bubbles and inflation.

A repricing of market interest rate expectations to anticipate a Fed hike as early as late 2022 is at odds with the Fed’s aim of keeping rates unchanged until the end of 2023. The Fed has appeared unperturbed so far by higher bond yields, but it may feel it’s time to push back against those rate-hike bets.

It is also expected to release fresh forecasts on economic growth as vaccines are distributed.


2/ MIXING MESSAGES AT BOJThe central bank which pioneered yield curve control faces one of its toughest policy reviews on March 18-19.

The Bank of Japan will likely insert clearer guidance in its statement on what it sees as an acceptable level of fluctuation in long-term interest rates, according to sources -- a sign it won’t tolerate rises that hurt the economy.

Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his deputy Masayoshi Amamiya have sent mixed messages on loosening the 10-year yield target band. Higher yields would acknowledge a global move higher but might spur unintended worries about policy tightening.

Given a nascent economic recovery, the BOJ may even suggest scope for more negative short-term rates. In the midst of this, financial year-end flows back into yen are accelerating. A currency rally will add to the BOJ’s headaches.


3/BOE, NORGES BANK TOOThursday brings central bank meetings in Britain and Norway.

The Bank of England is not seen unveiling additional policy easing despite concerns over the recent spike in borrowing costs.

Instead, any action such as upping the BoE’s bond-buying firepower is likely to come later in the year - perhaps in May, when the next set of economic forecasts emerge.

With first-quarter GDP data expected to show a near 4% drop on the back of pandemic-linked lockdowns and Brexit disruptions, economic recovery is expected to be gradual. A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect GDP will take two years to return to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Norges Bank is also tipped to keep rates unchanged but it may adopt a much more hawkish tone given signs of economic recovery in Norway, especially in housing.


4/EMERGING RATES ON RISEIn emerging markets, meanwhile, the only way for interest rates to go may be up. That’s the message we might hear from several central banks over coming days.

Most have faced rising inflation pressures for some time but now they are also confronted by higher U.S. Treasury yields, which raise borrowing costs for everyone. For oil importers, Brent crude prices above $70 is an added problem -- all this while economies are still reeling from the coronavirus impact.

Central banks in Brazil and Turkey -- meeting on Wednesday and Thursday respectively -- are most likely to raise rates. Markets will also find out on Thursday if Indonesia’s rate-cutting cycle has come to an end.

Egypt meanwhile is seen standing pat on Thursday even in the face of rising commodity prices and inflation nudging higher.


5/ELECTIONSIn the euro area, investors’ focus turns to politics.

The German states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate hold elections on Sunday that are seen as a key test of voter sentiment ahead of national polls in September which will determine who succeeds Angela Merkel as Chancellor.

The Baden-Wuerttemberg vote is one to watch, since a face mask procurement scandal has muddied the waters for Merkel’s Christian Democrats, whose leader Armin Laschet hopes to become the next Chancellor.

Then there are Dutch national elections on March 15-17, for which authorities are relaxing evening curfew rules introduced to combat the spread of COVID-19. Polls suggest Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s conservative VVD will remain the largest party, although public support has declined recently over his coronavirus policies.

"March 13,2021",Did AMFI do a U-turn on Sebi’s AT1 bond rule for mutual funds?,Industry watchers and investor protection groups agree that the Sebi circular was in the investor interest. ,"While the Finance Ministry’s ‘request’ to Sebi to withdraw the new valuation rule for perpetual bonds surprised many, what intrigued industry watchers more was mutual fund body Amfi's U-turn to side with the markets regulator on an issue, which the industry had objected to when the rules were first notified on Wednesday, March 10.

Two days later on Friday, the industry body said it fully supports the capital markets regulator’s new rule, which puts a cap on mutual fund exposure to perpetual bonds. In a statement, the Association of Mutual Funds in India said: ""it fully supports the need and spirit of the circular in capping exposure to perpetual bonds.""

Industry watchers and investor protection groups agree that the Sebi circular was in the investor interest. It was, in a way, follow-up action to an earlier move in which the markets regulator had in October 2020 banned direct purchase of perpetual or AT1 bonds of banks by retail investors.

This action followed a fiasco involving YES Bank, which had allegedly sold these unsecured bonds to retail investors in the guise of higher interest-bearing bank fixed deposits and then wrote them off when the bank's finances came under stress.

For the uninitiated, banks issue these AT1 bonds -- also called perpetual bonds -- to raise core capital. They pay very attractive rates of interest, but are very risky as the issuer can avoid paying interest on them if its finances come under stress and can even totally extinguish them if it goes belly up.

The size of total outstanding AT-1 bonds in the market is estimated at Rs 90,000 crore, out of which the mutual fund industry holding is pegged at Rs 35,000 crore. Besides mutual funds, banks, corporates and high net worth individuals invest in this product.

Sebi's new rule caps mutual fund exposure to such bonds at 10 per cent of total assets, limits it at 10 per cent of assets for a single scheme and at 5 per cent of total assets in case of bonds from a single issuer. The order said if a mutual fund scheme currently holds such investments exceeding these limits, they will be grandfathered, meaning they will not need to sell them, but will not buy more till the limit is reached.

Fund houses by and large agree to these rules, and insist that most schemes hold such bonds within the stipulated limits.

The issue was largely with the new bond valuation rule that Sebi ordered, which said the tenure of such bonds will be considered as 100 years as they are perpetual. This also implies that closed-ended schemes will not be able to invest in these bonds because they will not have such a long tenure.

The fear was that this rule, if implemented, would drive informed institutional investors to withdraw large sums from debt funds, which may then trigger a run on such schemes.

Besides, as mutual funds adjust to the new valuation rule, it would result in a hit on NAVs, leading to losses for investors, denting sentiment and trigger redemptions. Some industry estimates projected a Rs 4,000-5,000 crore hit on the industry. This was also expected to create a turmoil in the bond market.

While analysts and industry watchers feel the FinMin move may have been triggered by concerns over the impact that the 100-year rule can have on banks, in particular, and the bond market as a whole, Amfi's posturing surprised many.

ETMarkets contacted the mutual fund body for further clarification on the issue, but is yet to receive any response.

An industry leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Sebi did hold discussions on this in the mutual fund committee in which Amfi has representations, and thus, they were party to this. ""However, it seems, there was no clarity on the valuation part and it was left to Sebi to decide,"" he said.

The fine print of the Amfi release has a hint of this.

It shows while the industry body, in principle, backs the Sebi move to derisk the mutual fund industry vis-à-vis this particular instrument given the experiences of the recent past with the Franklin Templeton episode and the IL&FS fiasco, it has actually kept mum on the 100-year valuation rule.

The release puts forth Amfi’s view on the valuation point tacitly, saying most trades in perpetual bonds happen on a yield-to-Call basis. “This is based on the established market convention, locally as well as globally, that the issuer will exercise the Call option on the due date,” it said.

Amfi seems to be calling for a new valuation mechanism for this, to be formulated jointly by Sebi and Amfi. “Market-determined price is the best price to arrive at a valuation, which is fair to investors, who are subscribing, redeeming or staying invested in a mutual fund scheme. Amfi under guidance from Sebi has worked over the years to create a robust valuation process. Two independent agencies can administer the process to ensure industry-wide fair and common valuation for the debt portfolio across mutual funds,"" the release states. 

In a television interview, Amfi Chairman Nilesh Shah said the industry body is in agreement with Sebi that there should be restrictions on exposure to the perpetual bonds. He insisted most mutual fund schemes as on date hold such bonds below the limit prescribed by Sebi.

""The MF industry is fully committed to the Sebi guideline on valuation that market prices should get precedence. As much as 60-80 per cent of what mutual funds hold today get traded on a regular basis, and market prices should get precedence there. For the 15-20 per cent of the portfolio, we have to fix a model to derive valuation,"" he said.

Shah said the problem is narrower than what was made out to be. ""The market should develop, but at the same time we have to ensure transparency, investor protection and correct & fair valuation of these instruments so that investors get fair treatment,"" he said.

He claimed there was neither any increase in credit risk nor liquidity risk in the perpetual bond market, as there was no material move in interest rates or panic selloff on Friday.

A cursory glance at mutual fund industry’s AT-1 holdings shows select credit risk funds have maximum exposure to these bonds.

Some dynamic bond funds were also found to be having sizeable exposure as were a few banking and PSU funds.

"March 13,2021",Indian economy looking at 'V-shaped' recovery: Anurag Thakur,"""India is already looking at 'V-shaped' recovery. Along with the green shoots in various sectors, in the month of February, FPI inflows were Rs 25,787 crore,"" Thakur said at a virtual conclave organised by the Institute of Actuaries of India.","There are green shoots visible in various sectors of the economy and the country is already looking at a 'V-shaped' recovery, Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur said on Saturday. ""India is already looking at 'V-shaped' recovery. Along with the green shoots in various sectors, in the month of February, FPI inflows were Rs 25,787 crore,"" Thakur said at a virtual conclave organised by the Institute of Actuaries of India. 

 After two consecutive quarters of contraction, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) entered into a positive territory with a growth of 0.4 per cent in the October-December quarter of the current fiscal, according to the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) in February. 

 Thakur said the country' foreign exchange reserves, which have been steadily increasing over the last few months, had touched all time high at USD 590 billion in January 2021. 

 He said the accretion to the forex reserves in the last eight month was USD 100 billion. 

 ""These are signs of confidence that the global funds and investors look at India as a destination to invest and they are bullish about India's growth story,"" Thakur added.

"March 13,2021",Is ELSS really a good choice as a tax-saving investment?,"In recent years, it can be seen that many taxpayers have turned to ELSS schemes to avail of tax benefits. In this article, we will discuss different aspects of tax-saving ELSS or equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds.","There are a variety of options to choose from in mutual fund schemes, based on one's risk appetite and financial goals. If one is looking for investment opportunities that can help them generate wealth, get regular returns, and/or save taxes, then ELSS becomes a great investment choice.

In recent years, it can be seen that many taxpayers have turned to ELSS schemes to avail of tax benefits. In this article, we will discuss different aspects of tax-saving ELSS or equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds.

ELSS funds are equity-linked funds that invest a major portion of their corpus into equity or equity-related instruments. They are also called tax-saving schemes since they offer tax exemption from your annual taxable income under Section 80C of the Income-Tax Act. 

Most ELSS funds invest across a diverse group of companies ranging from smallcaps to largecaps from across sectors. This allows one to add an element of diversification to the investment portfolio. Also, ELSS schemes have a mandatory lock-in period of three years. So, any investment made in ELSS funds will be locked for three years and investors can redeem their units only after the lock-in gets over.

ELSS funds are prone to the inherent volatility of the equity market, but have the potential to generate superior returns in the long term. The volatility risk can be mitigated by investing in ELSSes through the SIP mode. While you can invest a lumpsum amount in an ELSS scheme, most investors prefer the SIP mode as it allows them to invest in small amounts and avail tax benefits along with the opportunity to create wealth.

If your aim is to create wealth by investing in ELSS funds, the selection of the right scheme holds the key. Investors should make the selection based on a scheme’s consistent performance over the long term.

Make sure there is proper diversification across marketcaps and industries. Before you make a decision on which instrument to use for your tax saving, make sure you have outlined your financial goals and invest accordingly.

"March 13,2021",Wall Street week ahead: Energy shares look for next spark as investors eye recovering economy,"With a gain of over 80 per cent in that time, the S&P 500 energy sector is back to levels last seen in February 2020, when the stock market began its plunge as the Covid-19 outbreak took its toll on the economy.","By Lewis Krauskopf

 NEW YORK: Investors betting on U.S. energy shares have enjoyed a blistering rally, as the sector leads a move into value and economically sensitive stocks that has gripped the equity market. How much further that run continues could hinge on the success of the economic recovery, supply dynamics in oil markets and whether companies can stay disciplined on spending.

 The near doubling in the price of crude has helped make shares of oil and gas companies - for years a losing bet - one of the best performing areas of the market, with outsized gains in the stocks of companies such as oil major Exxon Mobil Corp and Diamondback Energy Inc, which have surged 89 per cent and 231 per cent, respectively, since early November.

 With a gain of over 80 per cent in that time, the S&P 500 energy sector is back to levels last seen in February 2020, when the stock market began its plunge as the Covid-19 outbreak took its toll on the economy.

 ""Shares are being bid up because there are expectations for greater demand,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. ""We need to see the follow-through.""

 The outlook for energy shares is at the center of a number of market themes, including how long the economic ""reopening"" trade can last, whether energy and other value stocks can continue outperforming tech and growth shares and if the market is primed for a potential rise in inflation.

 With the benchmark S&P 500 nearing the 4,000 level for the first time, the health of the economy, the pace of inflation and a recent rise in bond yields are expected to be hot topics when the U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 Ample crude supply that weighed on global oil prices and concerns over a push toward ""green energy"" were among the factors pulling down energy stocks for most of the past decade. Oil prices plummeted in the coronavirus-fueled downturn amid global travel restrictions and shutdowns but roared higher in recent months, buoyed by breakthroughs in vaccines against Covid-19.

 Recent data has shown signs of an economic recovery continuing to gain momentum. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped to a four-month low last week, while U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year.

 Prices for U.S. crude are up 35 per cent year-to-date.

 Investors are watching supply dynamics as another catalyst for crude prices and energy stocks.

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies last year cut output substantially as demand collapsed due to the pandemic. The group earlier this month agreed to extend most output cuts into April.

 Any efforts by President Joe Biden's administration to regulate U.S. drilling could support prices by keeping supply in check, investors said.

 ""There is more likely to be an aggressive regulatory regime, which would rein in supply, which would be a positive for commodity prices,"" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group.

 Investors said they want to see whether companies are spending on new drilling, which could oversupply the market and eventually weigh on prices, or pay down debt and bolster dividends.

 Five international oil majors cut their capital spending by about 20 per cent on average last year to $80 billion and are expected in aggregate to generally maintain that spending level in 2021, according to Jason Gabelman, senior energy equity research analyst at Cowen.

 Energy companies ""need to maintain their discipline, they need to stick to capital budgets that are constrained and not drill as much and give investors confidence that this is not going to be a short-lived cycle,"" said Christian Ledoux, director of investment research at CAPTRUST.

 Setbacks in fighting the virus could undercut the reopening trade and energy shares along with it. Such a scenario risks playing out in Europe, where a more contagious variant of the coronavirus has pushed Italy and France to impose fresh lockdowns.

 Another factor is how quickly travel might rebound to pre-pandemic levels.

 ""You may see reopening and people driving more and spending more on commerce, but ... if people are traveling less globally, that is going to result in oil demand not fully recovering to where it was,"" Gabelman said.

"March 13,2021",Citi turns defensive as valuations and international commodity prices soar,"Citi has a target of 14,800 on the Nifty by December this year, which implies a minor downside from current levels. The Nifty closed at 15,030.95 on Friday.","Mumbai: Citigroup has tweaked its model portfolio to be more defensive given elevated valuations and multiple risks, including high commodity prices. The firm has reallocated weightage from financials to defensives such as consumer staples, utilities, IT, and pharma. It has removed IndusInd Bank from the portfolio after outperformance in the last few months.

“Continued rise in commodity prices + elevated FY22 estimated consensus growth expectations with valuations at over 21 times FY22 estimated EPS are the risks,” said Citi’s Surendra Goyal and Vijit Jain.

Citi has a target of 14,800 on the Nifty by December this year, which implies a minor downside from current levels. The Nifty closed at 15,030.95 on Friday.

Citi said oil prices remain in a cycle, but a super-cycle is unlikely.

However, the prospects for a super-cycle in copper and aluminium are real, said Citi which is overweight on metals in its model portfolio by 60 basis points.

History suggests that rising commodity prices are not necessarily detrimental to corporate earnings, growth is possibly the more important variable as it allows pricing power and collapse in commodity prices have tended to push margins higher. The firm said post Covid-19 recovery trends, beyond the base effect, might be the most crucial.

"March 13,2021","Finance Ministry writes to Sebi, 'requests' agency to withdraw perpetual bond rule",The ministry's objection is to the rule that requires debt mutual funds to value perpetual bonds as a 100-year instrument from April 1. Fund managers too had raised concerns over this. ,"The finance ministry ""requested"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Friday to withdraw the part of its Wednesday circular that changed the rules followed by mutual funds to value perpetual bonds. The capital market regulator hadn't responded to the suggestion at press time, but is expected to review the rules before they take effect on April 1, said people with knowledge of the matter. The move by the ministry was a rare instance of such a government intervention being made public, experts said.

The ministry's objection is to the rule that requires debt mutual funds to value perpetual bonds as a 100-year instrument from April 1. Fund managers too had raised concerns over this.

""Considering the capital needs of banks going forward and the need to source the same from the capital markets, it is requested that the revised valuation norms to treat all perpetual bonds as 100-year tenor be withdrawn,"" said an office memorandum to the Sebi chairman.

With the regulator yet to respond, the undertone is nervous.

Sebi is expected to review the new rules after examining the views it's received on the issue so far. The regulator is likely to issue a revised circular before April 1, when the new rules on valuation of perpetual bonds are to take effect.

""The steps Sebi has taken are in the interest of investors. Some stakeholders may have certain concerns but Sebi's mandate is to protect investors,"" said a person close to the development. Mutual fund industry officials and lawyers said Sebi might aim for a compromise to resolve the concerns of the market and the government.




Letter highlighted impact on yields, NAVs, fund raising
""It appears to be a recommendation from the government and not a directive,"" said Sandeep Parekh, founder, Finsec Law Advisors, and a former executive director at Sebi.

On Friday morning, yields on perpetual bonds - especially those belonging to smaller issuers - shot up in reaction to the circular. Some bond traders were seeking yields 20-30 basis points higher, while verbal demands had risen to as much as 80 basis points before word spread that finance ministry had stepped in. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

Perpetual bonds of SBI yielded 7.53%, those of Canara Bank were at 8.20%, South Indian Bank at 14.06%. Bonds of Bank of Baroda and Rural Electrification Corp (REC) also changed hands at 7.69-8.13% during the day. Yields were up by about 10 basis points for reported deals.

Fund managers said attempts to sell the perpetual bonds of smaller issuers in morning trade were unsuccessful in the absence of liquidity. Many mutual funds were understood to have sold some of their liquid bonds to be ready for any possible redemption pressure in schemes that hold perpetual bonds. Industry executives said redemption requests were modest on Friday with the finance ministry note easing frayed sentiment.

""Mutual funds were building a cash chest by selling some liquid securities. Nobody wants to be in a situation like what happened during Franklin Templeton,"" said a senior mutual fund industry participant.

The finance ministry letter highlighted the adverse impact of the rule on bond yields, net asset value (NAV) of debt mutual funds and fund raising by public sector banks.

""Panic redemption by mutual funds would impact overall corporate bond market as MFs may resort to selling other bonds to raise liquidity in debt schemes,"" the letter said. ""This could lead to higher borrowing costs by corporates at a time when economic recovery is still nascent.""

Mutual funds are among the biggest holders of perpetual bonds. They currently hold more than Rs 35,000 crore of the outstanding Additional Tier 1 issuances of about Rs 90,000 crore, the letter said.

The debt scheme categories that hold this instrument include banking and PSU funds, dynamic bond funds and credit-risk funds among others with up to five-year maturity. Hybrid funds also hold such bonds.

Perpetual bonds have a five-year call option, which allows holders to exit instead of staying invested permanently. Fund managers had opposed the latest Sebi rule as it required debt schemes to value this security as a 100-year paper instead of a valuation assigned to a shorter maturity. This could result in yields on perpetual bonds shooting up and prices falling, causing losses to holders. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.

With the capital market regulator changing the valuation rule, bond traders were expecting a surge in yields of as much as 100 basis points. Banks, major issuers of perpetual paper, would have faced higher costs in seeking to raise funds through the avenue. Banks were said to have been preparing to approach the Reserve Bank of India seeking relaxation of the norms. They have issued nearly 93% of total outstanding perpetual bonds, pegged at Rs 1.46 lakh crore, show data compiled by JM Financial.

"March 13,2021","Indices fall 1% on rising US bond yields, lockdown fears","BEAR TURN Sensex slips 487.43 points, Nifty down 143.85 points, though both managed to record 2nd consecutive weekly gains. Volatility index climbs 4.6% to end at 21.71","Mumbai: Stock indices fell 1% on Friday, giving up early gains on the back of a rise in bond yields in US and Europe and surge in India coronavirus cases that has triggered fear of fresh lockdown.

The Sensex slipped 487.43 points, or 0.95%, to close at 50,792.08 and the Nifty fell 143.85 points, or 0.95%, to close at 15,030.95. However, both indices managed to log a second consecutive weekly gain.

The volatility index India VIX, which measures the market’s perception of risk in the near term, climbed 4.6% to end at 21.71 on Friday.

“The charts are showing there is some resistance occurring near the highs. We may not immediately go beyond 15300 in the near term,” said Rohit Srivastava, founder, Indiacharts.com.

“There is some seasonal pressure because it is the financial year end, so a short-term correction is likely,” said Srivastava. 

The signing of the US stimulus bill had lifted indices by nearly 1% earlier in the day before concern over rising bond yields weighed the market down. 

On Friday, foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of Indian shares worth `942.6 crore while DIIs net sold local shares worth `164 crore, provisional data on the NSE showed. “The net FII flows have not been very significant for the past two weeks despite global markets being strong and the stimulus in the US. It is very difficult for the market to continue moving up without the support of FII flows, which have been strong for the last ten months,” said Hemang Jani, head of equity strategy— broking and distribution at Motilal Oswal.

“Hardening of bond yields has also impacted sentiment despite stimulus being announced in the US- both 10-year and 30-year bonds,” said Jani. 

 Auto makers, Reliance Industries and financials were the biggest laggards of the day. Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki India, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Reliance Industries ended down 2-3%, worst hit among Sensex constituents. Among financials, IDBI Bank was an outlier as the stock ended up nearly 10% after the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday said it would take the PSU bank out of its corrective action list.

"March 13,2021",Govt finalises stake sale in Tata Communications,"The government will sell its 16.12% stake in Tata Communications through an offer for sale (OFS) and the remaining 10% will be sold to Panatone Finvest Ltd., an investment arm of Tata Sons. ","The government will sell a 16.12 per cent stake in Tata Communications through an offer for sale (OFS) and the remaining 10 per cent of its holding in the company to Panatone Finvest, an investment arm of Tata Sons.

The sale will bring an end to the government's nearly 20-year-old involvement in Tata Communications, formerly known as Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL).

The government will sell the 10 per cent stake to Panatone Finvest immediately after the OFS, at the price determined through the offering, Tata Communications said in an exchange filing late on Friday.

Tata Communications’ shares closed 2.65 per cent lower at Rs 1,289.75 Friday on the BSE. At that price, the government’s 26.12 per cent stake is worth more than Rs 9,600 crore. 

Panatone Finvest and Tata Sons hold 34.80 per cent and 14.07 per cent, respectively, in the company. The government, Panatone Finvest and Tata Sons are the promoters of the company. The government's holding was a big hurdle in the company's fundraising plans via equity, which meant it was dependent solely on debt funding to invest in business expansion.

VSNL was divested in 2002 by the government and the management control of the company was passed on to the strategic partner Panatone Finvest, a special purpose vehicle under the Tata Groups of Companies and a non-deposit-taking core investment arm of Tata Sons.

At that time, surplus land measuring 773.13 acres at five locations in four cities -- Pune, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai -- out of a total of 1230.13 acres held by VSNL, was kept out of the purview of the disinvestment deal. Panatone Finvest was to de-merge or hive off the land into a realty company, for which HPIL was created as a special purpose vehicle. That portion of the transaction has been completed.

Panatone Finvest also holds a more than 30 per cent stake in Tata Sons and Tata Power.

"March 13,2021",US stocks close mixed as Dow notches fifth straight record high,The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled after rebounding more than 6 per cent over the past three sessions as the rising bond yields revived inflation worries and dulled the appeal of high-growth technology shares.,"NEW YORK, - The blue-chip Dow powered to its fifth consecutive record high on Friday and the S&P 500 closed slightly higher as investors bought shares that should benefit from a strong reopening of the U.S. economy, an outlook signaled by rising yields in the bond market.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled after rebounding more than 6 per cent over the past three sessions as the rising bond yields revived inflation worries and dulled the appeal of high-growth technology shares.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly percentage gains since early February after President Joe Biden signed into law on Thursday one of the largest U.S. fiscal stimulus bills and data reinforced convictions the economy was headed to a high-growth recovery.

The recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields has raised fears of a sudden tapering of monetary stimulus and put downward pressure on Wall Street in recent weeks.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit 1.642 per cent on Friday, the highest level since February of last year.

Boeing Co rose 6.82 per cent to lead the Dow and S&P 500 higher. The rising Dow and tumbling Nasdaq reflect an ongoing sell-off in tech as investors buy cyclical and underpriced value stocks that are expected to do well as the economy recovers.

For tech stocks to continue to flourish you need low rates, and in effect slower growth, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC.

But with the stimulus package the economy is likely to expand 7 per cent to 9 per cent this year and pressure interest rates, he said.

""That's why you're seeing rates rise today because the reopening is happening faster and stronger than anticipated. And that's when value and cyclicals and economically sensitive stocks outperform,"" Hayes said.

The speedy distribution of vaccines and more fiscal aid have spurred concerns of rising inflation despite assurances from the Federal Reserve to maintain an accommodative policy. All eyes will be on the central bank's policy meeting next week for further cues on inflation.

U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year, a survey by the University of Michigan showed on Friday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 293.05 points, or 0.9 per cent, to close at 32,778.64 and the S&P 500 gained 4 points, or 0.10 per cent, to 3,943.34. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 78.81 points, or 0.59 per cent, to end at 13,319.87.

For the week, the S&P rose 2.6 per cent, the Dow added 4.1 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 3.1 per cent. For the Dow it was its biggest weekly gain since November.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.64 billion shares.

The Nasdaq has been particularly hit by the sell-off in recent weeks and confirmed a correction at the start of the week as investors swapped richly valued technology stocks with those of energy, mining and industrial companies that are poised to benefit more from an economic rebound.

Value stocks added about 0.80 per cent, while growth stocks slumped 0.62 per cent in a continuation of a rotation that began late last year.

The high-flying but yield-sensitive group of stocks including of Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and Microsoft Corp, which fueled the past's year rally, fell.

Tech, communication services and consumer discretionary indexes, which house these mega-cap stocks, slipped the most among major S&P sectors.

The bank index jumped 1.83 per cent, while financials and industrials clinched new record levels.

Ulta Beauty Inc fell 8.4 per cent after the cosmetics retailer forecast annual revenue below estimates, as demand for make-up products were under pressure due to extended work-from-home policies.

U.S.-listed shares of China-based JD.com Inc slid 6.7 per cent after three sources said the company is in talks to buy part or all of a stake in brokerage Sinolink Securities worth at least $1.5 billion.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 83 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 396 new highs and 12 new lows.

The deal, if approved, would put Tata - a more than 150-year-old group with interests in everything from luxury cars to software - in direct competition with Amazon, Walmart's Flipkart and an upstart grocery service from Reliance Industries, backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani.

In the filing with the Competition Commission of India, Tata Digital Ltd, a wholly owned unit of Tata Sons, proposed to buy 64.3% of an entity that runs business-to-business sales for BigBasket.

Media agencies have reported that the group aims to take control of more than 60% of BigBasket, buying out Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's stake.

The proposal comes as e-commerce sales, especially of food and groceries, have exploded in India as the COVID-19 pandemic spurred a shift to online shopping.

BigBasket's rivals are expected to spend heavily on the e-grocery business.

Flipkart has announced plans to expand to more Indian cities, while Reliance's digital unit - which is likely to support its grocery service - has raised more than $20 billion from investors including Facebook and Alphabet's Google.

"March 13,2021",China's Ant Group CEO leaves after failed IPO prompts revamp,"Hu, who was named the chief executive of the Alibaba Group Holding in 2019, will be replaced by company veteran and Executive Chairman Eric Jing, the financial technology giant said.","China's Ant Group Chief Executive Officer Simon Hu has unexpectedly resigned amid a regulatory-driven overhaul of the financial technology giant's business, the first top management exit since a scuppered $37 billion initial public offering.

Hu, who was named chief executive of the Alibaba Group Holding affiliate in 2019, will be replaced by company veteran and Executive Chairman Eric Jing, Ant said in a statement on Friday.

Hu's exit from the company comes as Ant is working on plans to shift to a financial holding company structure following intense regulatory pressure to subject it to rules and capital requirements similar to those for banks.

That pressure abruptly scuttled Ant's IPO last year, which would have been the world's biggest.

Hu resigned for personal reasons, Ant said in a statement, without elaborating.

""Following the board's thorough discussions, we have decided to respect Simon's personal request and support him fully in his new mission,"" Jing said in an internal memo, an excerpt of which was seen by Reuters.

Jing will continue in his current role as chairman, he said.

U.S.-listed shares in billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba dropped as much as 3.9% in the morning trade on Friday.

Hu's departure is the first major management change since the IPO was scrapped. He was one of the key executives responsible for managing the company's mega dual-listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai.


Financial ProblemsMa's business empire has been at the centre of a crackdown following an Oct. 24 speech in which he blasted China's regulatory system.

Regulators have since been tightening scrutiny of the country's technology sector, with Alibaba taking much of the heat. The regulator launched an official anti-trust probe into Alibaba in December.

Ma, who is not known for shying away from the limelight, disappeared from the public eye for about three months, prompting frenzied speculation about his whereabouts. He re-emerged in January in a 50-second video appearance.

Ant's financial holding structure is expected to weigh on its valuation, as the fintech firm was valued as a technology firm in its previous fundraising rounds. Typically, valuations are much higher on technology firms than on financial companies.

The change in management also comes days after some Ant staff expressed frustration on social media for not being able to sell the company shares they own after Chinese regulators abruptly halted the company's market debut.

Jing told Ant employees that the company would review its staff incentive programmes and roll out some measures starting from April to help solve their financial problems, according to two people who saw the messages.

The listing in November of Ant, whose businesses include consumer lending and insurance products distribution, would have made some of the company's employees millionaires or billionaires.

Although Ma has stepped down from corporate positions and earnings calls, he retains significant influence over Alibaba and Ant and promotes them globally at business and political events.

Hu joined Ant in 2005 and has worked in various roles in the group as well as at Alibaba, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Jing has been Ant's executive chairman since 2018 and before that he held various positions at the company including president and chief operating officer, according to his profile on the World Bank website. He joined Alibaba in 2007.

The index ended up forming a ‘Bearish Engulfing’ candle on the daily chart and a ‘Gravestone Doji’ formation on the weekly chart. The only silver lining for the day was that the index still managed to close above the 15,000 mark.

Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in said Nifty50 seems to be moving sideways and is drawing support from its 20-day exponential moving average that stands at 14,957, as it bounced back after testing the said average in four out of last five sessions to Friday.

""A close below the 14,950 level can accelerate the selling pressure with initial targets placed around 14,680 level and beyond that a retest of the recent low placed at 14,467 can’t be ruled out. Contrary to this, if Nifty sustains above the 15,000 mark on Monday, it can help the bulls bounce back towards the 15,250 mark. Upsides shall ideally remain capped around the 15,300 mark,"" he said.

For the day, Nifty closed at 15,030 level, down 143.85 points or 0.95 per cent.

“The index is now contained within a narrow range in the 14,850-15,270 zone. A break of the said range on either side will dictate the trend in the short term. However, on a larger picture, the market still remains deviated on the upside and a break below the recent low of 14,470 will trigger short-term weakness. Until then, traders can maintain a neutral to negative outlook,"" said Nirali Shah of Samco Securities.

Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking said the overall undertone has remained bullish, but the momentum is clearly lacking on all the key indices.

“As far as Nifty level is concerned, the 15,220-15,275 range is the immediate hurdle. If the index has to gain momentum, it needs to surpass this range. On the flipside, the 15,100 and 14,925 levels should be to watched. We are still a bit sceptical as far as the near-term view goes, and hence, advise traders to avoid aggressive bets,” Chavan said.

 BofA's weekly flows report showed investors put $31.5 billion into equities, while taking $1.8 billion out of gold and $15.4 billion out of bonds. Bond yields spiked higher last week on inflation fears, while high-flying tech stocks sold off as investors rotated into cheaper value stocks.

 Citing data from EPFR Global, BofA said last week saw the third-largest flows into emerging market stocks ever, and second-largest into value stocks.

 ""We believe 2020 marked a secular low point for inflation and rates,"" BofA said in the report, noting the big outperformance of the Russell 2000 index versus the tech-heavy NASDAQ.

 BofA also said the U.S. government will spend $879mn every hour in 2021 causing either a rise in bond yields, or a fall in the dollar to ""fund fiscal excess"". U.S. debt sustainability will cause higher volatility when higher yields combine with a lower U.S. dollar.

Indian Overseas Bank, Central Bank of India and UCO Bank are currently under this framework that puts several restrictions on them, including on lending, management compensation and directors' fees.

The ministry has almost finalised its names of probable candidates for capital infusion, sources said.

The infusion will be made in the next few days, the sources said, adding the biggest beneficiary of this round of capital infusion would be the banks that are under the prompt corrective action (PCA).

The capital infusion will help these banks to come out of the Reserve Bank of India's enhanced regulatory supervision or PCA framework.

Most of the large state-owned lenders -- including State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, and Indian Bank -- have already raised money from various market sources, including share sale on a private placement basis.

For the current financial year, the government had allocated Rs 20,000 crore for capital infusion into the PSBs for meeting the regulatory requirement.

Among the 12 PSBs, Punjab & Sind Bank was given Rs 5,500 crore in November last year.

Parliament had in September approved the Rs 20,000 crore capital infusion in the PSBs as part of the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2020-21.

Earlier this week, LIC controlled IDBI Bank was removed from the RBI's PCA framework after a gap of nearly four years on improved financial performance.

Shares of Tata Power rose 5.5% to their best closing level since June 9, 2014 after the report, which comes as the Palo Alto-based electric-car maker gears up for an India launch later this year with plans to import and sell its Model 3 electric sedan in India.

"Mar 12, 2021",AMFI backs Sebi on perpetual bond issue,"In a statement, the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) said ""it fully supports the need and spirit of the circular in capping exposure to perpetual bonds"".","Industry body Amfi on Friday said it fully supports the capital markets regulator Sebi's new rule, which puts a cap on mutual fund exposure to perpetual bonds. The industry body recognises that the risk profile of such instruments is higher than regular bonds. 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) came out with a circular on review of norms regarding investment in debt instruments with special features and the valuation of perpetual bonds on Wednesday. 

 Under the new rule, mutual funds cannot invest more than 10 per cent of the scheme's corpus in debt instruments, with special features such as perpetual bonds, and the exposure cannot not be more than 5 per cent to such debt instruments of the same company. 

 In addition, maturity of all perpetual bonds needs to be treated as 100 years from the date of issuance of the bond for the ""purpose of valuation"". 

 In a statement, the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) said ""it fully supports the need and spirit of the circular in capping exposure to perpetual bonds"". 

 It further said most of the mutual fund schemes are well below the cap specified in the circular. 

 In few of the schemes where perpetual bond exposure is higher than the Sebi prescribed cap, grand fathering is permitted by the regulator to ensure that there is no unnecessary market disruption, the industry body noted. 

 The industry body said Sebi had engaged with Amfi on treatment of perpetual bonds as it is a hybrid instrument and carries a differentiated risk reward ratio than a normal debt instrument. 

 Treatment of perpetual bonds was discussed in the Mutual Fund Advisory Committee (MFAC) where several members of Amfi participated. 

 Perpetual bonds or Additional Tier-I Bonds are issued without any maturity date but are usually issued with call options and qualify for Tier-I capital. Banks have been majority issuers of perpetual bonds. 

 The perpetual bond market is reasonably active with regular trades in large and higher rated issuances. Most trades in perpetual bonds happen on a yield to call basis. This is based on the established market convention, locally as well as globally, that the issuer will exercise the call option on the due date. 

 Amfi said it also supports Sebi's objective of fair valuation as market determined price is the best price to arrive at a valuation which is fair to investors who are subscribing, redeeming or staying invested in a mutual fund scheme. 

 The industry body under guidance from Sebi has worked over the years to create a robust valuation process and two independent agencies administer the process to ensure industry wide fair and common valuation for the debt portfolio across mutual funds. 

 The new circular continues the tradition of the primacy of traded prices, Amfi noted. 

 Perpetual bond market sees active participation from various players -- banks, corporates, mutual funds and individual investors. 

 ""Only in the event of lack of traded prices, the question arises as to whether the bond should be valued to call or to maturity. Given a reasonably active market with regular trades, the issue is narrower than it appears,"" it added. 

 Amfi said it is in discussion with Sebi to further smoothen the process of implementation of this circular. 

 The regulator has always been concerned about any potential mispricing of risk in any kind of instruments. 

 Recognising that mispricing of risk is not in the best interest of its investors, Amfi said it committed to working with Sebi to ensure fair valuation of its investments. 

 It is also fully committed to the regulator's objectives of investor protection and development of markets in India with the highest level of transparency. 

 While in the short-term prices can be influenced by many factors, in the long-term fundamentals will prevail, the industry body said.

""Long unwinding and profit booking took Indices down by 1 per cent today. Oil & gas stocks bucked the downtrend even as key Pivotals witnessed selling. Rising cases in Maharashtra too kept bulls on the backfoot as broader markets saw profit booking in Insurance companies,"" said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities.

Here are key factors that affected the market today:


Maharashtra lockdown
Maharashtra has been recording a substantial rise in coronavirus cases of late, with the authorities attributing it to crowding witnessed during the gram panchayat elections as the major reason. Not only Mumbai, Pune and Thane, but several cities and towns in Maharashtra, including Vidarbha and Marathwada regions, have been witnessing a spike in cases. Lockdown or restrictions have been imposed in several cities or districts in the state in a bid to prevent the spread of the virus.


Weak European marketsEuropean markets were trading lower at the last count. London-based FTSE was down 0.17 per cent while Paris and Frankfurt declined 0.05 per cent and 0.51 per cent, respectively. S&P 500 futures were also trading down 0.61 per cent. In Asia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand closed in the red while the rest registered gains.


Profit-bookingGeneral profit-booking was also seen, as the market had rallied for the last 3-4 sessions. Rising bond yields had been a risk factor even though that was offset to an extent by the US stimulus package. Fatigue was seen in afternoon deals, which led to a selloff. 


Technical viewEarlier in the day, Nifty had managed to surpass its previous minor high of 15,273. To continue the uptrend and advance towards its life-time high, it is crucial for the index to stay above 15,273, according to Abhishek Chinchalkar, CMT Charterholder and Head of Education, FYERS. “If not, the short-term consolidation is likely to continue,” he said.


""We reiterate our cautious view on markets until we see a decisive break on either side in Nifty, and suggest keeping a check on leveraged positions.""— Ajit Mishra, Religare BrokingAmong the blue chip scrips, BPCL was the top gainer, rising 3.05 per cent. Indian Oil, Power Grid, JSW Steel Titan, ONGC, Infosys and Shree Cement were other gainers.

Bajaj Auto was the top loser in the Nifty pack, falling 3.01 per cent. Adani Ports, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, Hindalco, Maruti Suzuki and Sun Pharma were other stocks that ended in the red.

Broader market indices ended on a mixed note, but managed to outperform their headline peers. Nifty Smallcap added 0.52 per cent and Nifty Midcap declined 0.43 per cent. Nifty 500 -- the broadest index on NSE -- fell 0.77 per cent.

Tata Power, Oberoi Realty, Adani Total Gas, IDBI, Welspun India and Delta Corps were top gainers from the mid- and small-cap indices, climbing in the range of 3-10 per cent.

Indiabulls Real Estate, Aegis Chemicals, Rain Industries, Dhani Services, Castrol India and Max Financial Services were major losers from broader market space, falling in the range of 3-10 per cent.

All sectoral indices on the NSE ended with cuts. Nifty PSU Bank was the biggest loser, down 1.7 per cent followed by 1.66 per cent decline in Nifty Financial Service. Nifty Auto and Nifty Pharma were other big losers.

The firm has reallocated weightage from financials into defensives such as consumer staples, utilities, IT, and pharma. It has removed IndusInd from the portfolio after outperformance in the last few months. 

""Continued rise in commodity prices + elevated FY22 estimated consensus growth expectations with valuations at over 21 times FY22 estimated EPS is the risk,"" said Citi's Surendra Goyal and Vijit Jain. 

Citi has a target of 14,800 on the Nifty by December this year which implies a minor downside from current levels. 

Citi said oil prices remain in a cycle, but a super-cycle is unlikely.

However, the prospects for a super-cycle in copper and aluminium are real, said Citi which is overweight on metals in its model portfolio by 60 basis points. 

History suggests that rising commodity prices are not necessarily detrimental to corporate earnings, growth is possibly the more important variable as it allows pricing power and collapse in commodity prices have tended to push margins higher. The firm said post Covid-19 recovery trends, beyond the base effect, might be the most crucial.

For the services industry it includes the cycle of getting business to executing the task. ,"Mumbai: ‘Operations risk’ has emerged as one of the key concerns for India’s bluechip companies as the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the client and supply chains across the globe. According to a survey conducted by Excellence Enablers – a corporate governance firm founded by former Securities and Exchange Board of India(Sebi) chairman M Damodaran – 46 out of the Nifty Fifty companies have reported Operations risk as a key concern in their FY20 annual reports. In FY19, only 29 companies viewed operations as a risk area.

Operations include everything from procuring the raw materials to selling the end products. For the services industry it includes the cycle of getting business to executing the task. While the risk may be on account of disruptions due to the pandemic and lockdowns, companies have been conservative when it comes to terming Covid-19 itself as a risk.

“It is interesting to note that in FY 2019-20, with annual reports being published several months post the closure of the FY, only 28 companies have recognised Covid-19 as a risk,” the report said.

According to the report, Financial risk is the most prominently featured risk by the companies as all the 50 under study have mentioned it as a key risk. The number was 48 in FY19. Financial risk involves risks related to credit, market liquidity, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

In FY20, IT risks took a backseat with only 42 companies calling it a risk against 46 in FY19. IT risks include issues such as data privacy, cyber threats, and other system related issues. This is a key component for services companies including the banks and IT companies.
